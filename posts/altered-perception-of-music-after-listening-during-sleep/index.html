            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Sometime in 2014-2015, I fell asleep while listening to a song on repeat, which did not stop for the
                whole duration of my sleep. Then, after waking up and listening to it once again, I was astonished to
                find out that the song no longer sounded the same. Instead, the layers of the sound (multiple electric
                guitars, bass, synths) were jumbled up, messy, and distorted. As if someone had tweaked the EQ settings
                of the song. Also, the vocals did not sound as clear as before, and the drums seemed off.</p>

            <p>One other important aspect of this effect was in the details of the song. Previously, many small details
                had my attention, such as drum fills, specific chord changes, synth licks, and such. Now, however, all
                of the previously noticed quirks were unnoticeable, hidden somewhere in the background. Instead, new and
                weird details were noticeable, such as other drum fills, a peculiar ride cymbal, and other guitar layers
                buried deep in the mix. It's as if a particular version of the song was unlocked by my brain, with many
                hidden layers of the sound being jarringly prominent.</p>

            <p>Initially, I thought I broke my headphones during sleep, yet the effect persisted even with different
                headphones and devices.
                I tried listening to other songs, but they sounded just as normal as before. Amazingly, it was just this
                one song that I no longer perceived the same as before.
                After a couple of hours, the effect seemed to have faded a little bit, and by the next day, it
                disappeared completely.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>Trying to search for this exact phenomenon proved to be difficult, as any meaningful results were scarce.
                Only a dozen of people on Reddit, Quora, and a couple of other forums seemed to have experienced the
                exact thing as me.</p>

            <p><em>"I've found on many occasions that if I listen to a specific song on repeat whilst I sleep, it sounds
                    very different when I play it again the next day. I usually have to check that it actually is the
                    same version of the song. I can't pinpoint what specifically sounds different. It just sounds like a
                    cover of the song. It's hard to describe."</em></p>
            <p><em>"I'm a fan of Lady Gaga's song Aura, and recently slept while having the song play on loop. I played
                    the track again a few hours after waking up, and I could not recognize anything in the song except
                    for the lyrics, it's like all of the layers and the production were jumbled up to create an entirely
                    different sound. I was wondering if anyone here had similar experiences with this "phenomena"?"</em>
            </p>
            <p><em>"The tone and the instruments seem really off, it almost sounds like someone tried doing a cover of
                    the song, a really bad one."</em></p>
            <p>I could not find any formal research on this topic, let alone any information at all besides some forum
                posts.</p>

            <h3>Achieving the Effect</h3>
            <p>The main problem is finding a way of correctly measuring the effect, as it seems highly subjective. It
                would be easy to confuse it with something else if the setup is not proper. What kind of description do
                you have to give to a song before the effect to compare it later easily?</p>
            <h4>Conditions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The song must be 'catchy' enough that you could listen to it on repeat for tens, hundreds of times.
                </li>
                <li>The song must not disrupt your sleep and let you easily fall asleep.</li>
                <li>Must use earphones or headphones during sleep that would not fall out right away and disrupt you or
                    cause pain/too much discomfort.</li>
                <li>Alternatively, use speakers situated nearby.</li>
                <li>The song must be familiar to you already but still catchy enough that you are not 'burned out' of
                    listening to it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Will this phenomenon work every time?</li>
                <li>Will this work for everyone, every song?</li>
                <li>During which part of sleep does this happen?</li>
                <li>In which part of the brain does this happen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experiments</h3>
            <p>As of June 2021, I am experimenting with experiencing this phenomenon once again.
                You can find the results of my experiments in the table below.
                So far, I've had trouble staying asleep for long with music repeatedly playing in the background,
                even at quiet volumes.

            <p>New findings:</p>
            <p>The altered perception of a song stays unchanged if the song is not being listened to after the effect first appeared. The previous perception slowly returns only after listening to the song multiple times again. Otherwise, many days can pass and you might discover that the song sounds somewhat strange when listening to it again.</p>
